# Roadmap

Planned work for the Logo interpreter, roughly in priority order within each
section. Update this alongside `LANGUAGE.md` as items land — move a
finished item's description into the language reference and delete it here
rather than marking it "done" in place.

## Language

Standard Berkeley Logo features this interpreter doesn't have yet — see
`docs/FEATURE_ATLAS.md` for the full survey this list is drawn from. Ordered
smallest-to-largest lift, so working top to bottom tackles the cheap, clearly-
scoped items first.

- [ ] A "wait for a keypress" pause, as an alternative to `WAIT`'s
  time-based one — has no real Logo precedent and needs actual
  interactive input handling mid-script (the entry box would need to feed
  a keypress back into a running `eval_logo` call), a materially bigger
  lift than `WAIT` was.

## Robustness

- [ ] Grow `tests/test_interpreter.c`'s coverage as new language features
  land (it currently covers turtle motion, procedures/scoping, `IF`/
  `WHILE`/booleans, words, and the error-message paths — see `make test`).
- [ ] `eval_logo`'s 200-call recursion cap (`MAX_SCOPE_DEPTH`) is close to,
  but not confirmed over, a stack-safety edge under AddressSanitizer —
  found 2026-08-05 while stress-testing `RUN`/`APPLY`. `eval_logo` is one
  giant function with every command as a branch, compiled at `-O0`, so
  each new feature's locals add to its per-call stack frame even though
  only one branch runs per call; 200 levels of recursion now overflows
  under ASan's inflated overhead, though every plain (non-ASan) run has
  passed cleanly. Left as-is for now rather than lowering the documented
  cap or splitting `eval_logo` into smaller per-command functions — revisit
  if a real (non-ASan) crash from deep recursion is ever reported.
